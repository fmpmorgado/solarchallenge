Open Cosmos solar panel challenge

A package to simulate the power generated by a solar panel orbiting the Earth, solving the two-body problem, computing the power using a single-diode model alternative and performing thermal analysis of the solar panel using a lumped mass approach.

For an example of how to use it and information on the integrated models, please take a look at the Demo.ipynb file.
